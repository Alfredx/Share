XShare
======

A new way to share between devices.

You may also consider it as a HTML5 version of [bump][bump] (just a prototype, though).

======

The following HTML(5) features might be employed:

* [Geolocation][geo]: to determine pairing together with time
* Sensor APIs: capture shaking motions
* [File API][file]: Read local files
* \<input type="file"\>: choose file to share
* WebSockets?
* Server-Sent-Events?
* TO BE CONTINUED..
